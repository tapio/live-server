Live Server
===========

This is a little development server with live reload capability. Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.

There are two reasons for using this:

1. AJAX requests don't work with the `file://` protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript.
2. Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.

If you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something simpler, like the following Python-based one-liner:

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer


Installation
------------

You need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.

**Npm way**

	npm install -g live-server

**Manual way**

	git clone https://github.com/tapio/live-server
	cd live-server
	npm install # Local dependencies if you want to hack
	npm install -g # Install globally


Usage from command line
-----------------------

Issue the command `live-server` in your project's directory. Alternatively you can add the path to serve as a command line parameter.

This will automatically launch the default browser (you should have `index.html` present). When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.

Command line parameters:

* `--port=NUMBER` - select port to use (can also be done with PORT environment variable)
* `--no-browser` - suppress automatic web browser launching
* `--quiet` - suppress logging
* `--open=PATH` - launch browser to PATH instead of server root
* `--ignore=PATH` - comma-separ	ated string of paths to ignore
* `--entry-file=PATH` - serve this file in place of missing files (useful for single page apps)
* `--wait=MILLISECONDS` - wait for all changes, before reloading
* `--proxyPath=/path1,path2:redirectPort` - proxy internally path that starts with path1,path2 to redirect port


Usage from node
---------------

```javascript
var liveServer = require("live-server");

var params = {
	port: 8181, // Set the server port. Defaults to 8080.
	host: "0.0.0.0", // Set the address to bind to. Defaults to 0.0.0.0.
	root: "/public", // Set root directory that's being server. Defaults to cwd.
	open: false, // When false, it won't load your browser by default.
	ignore: 'scss,my/templates', // comma-separated string for paths to ignore
	file: "index.html", // When set, serve this file for every 404 (useful for single-page applications)
	wait: 1000, // Waits for all changes, before reloading. Defaults to 0 sec.
	proxyPath: "/api,/login:8081" //proxy request internally to /api or /login, to port 8080, defaults to none
};
liveServer.start(params);
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

Open your browser's console: there should be a message at the top stating that live reload is enabled. If there are errors, deal with them. You will need a browser that supports WebSockets.


How it works
------------

The server is a simple node app that serves the working directory and its subdirectories. It also watches the files for changes and when that happens, it sends a message through a web socket connection to the browser instructing it to reload. In order for the client side to support this, the server injects a small piece of JavaScript code to each requested html file. This script establishes the web socket connection and listens to the reload requests.
