JSPM Server
===========

This is a little development server for devving on JSPM sites. It's based on (and owes 99% of its smarts) to @tapio's excellent [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).

If you don't need JSPM stuff, use live-server, and if you don't need live-reloading at all, use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` 


Installation
------------

You need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.

**Npm way**

	npm install -g jspm-server

Usage from command line
-----------------------

Issue the command `jspm-server` in your project's directory. Alternatively you can add the path to serve as a command line parameter.

You can configure the port to be used by the server by adding the `--port=<number>` runtime option when invoking jspm-server, or by setting the `PORT` environment variable prior to running jspm-server.

Additional parameters:

* `--no-browser` - suppress automatic web browser launching
* `--quiet` - suppress logging
* `--open=PATH` - launch browser to PATH instead of server root

How it works
------------

This is a variant of `live-server` that uses a payload of [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)-aware hooks, and looks for plugins that export a `hotReload` function. It then cache-busts the resource and `System.import`s it. The logic all lives in [ChangeHandler](https://github.com/geelen/jspm-server/blob/master/lib/change-handler.js). At the moment, there are two plugins that support live-reloading, and they're mega hacks (both of them reload as a side-effect, and aren't properly wired into the SystemJS loader). They are:

- [postcss](https://github.com/geelen/plugin-postcss)
- [jsx](https://github.com/geelen/typeslab/blob/master/src/jsx.js)


Version history
---------------

* v0.0.3
	- Added dependency-tracking, once a file has been live-reloaded, attempt to live-reload all of its dependents.
	  Note: requires `System.trace = true` to be in your project ahead of your initial `System.import` to take effect.
* v0.0.2
	- Added a `html5mode`, where if a `200.html` is present in the root directory, any url that doesn't contain a `.` will serve it instead. Enables single-page apps nicely.
* v0.0.1
	- Forked from v0.7.1 of [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server)
